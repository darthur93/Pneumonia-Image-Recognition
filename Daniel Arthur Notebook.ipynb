    "Pneumonia is an infection of one or both of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It is a serious infection in which the air sacs fill with pus and other liquid. Lobar pneumonia affects one or more sections (lobes) of the lungs. Pneumonia accounts for 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old, killing 740 180 children in 2019 The cost of antibiotic treatment for all children with pneumonia in 66 of the countdown to 2015 countries for maternal, newborn and child survival is estimated at around US$ 109 million per year. The price includes the antibiotics and diagnostics for pneumonia management. treat pneumonia focusing on making sure that every sick child has access to the right kind of care -- either from a community-based health worker, or in a health facility if the disease is severe -- and can get the antibiotics and oxygen they need to get well; Pneumonia is the world’s biggest infectious killer of adults and children – claiming 2.5 million lives, including 672,000 children under five, in 2019. That’s one person dying every 13 seconds"
